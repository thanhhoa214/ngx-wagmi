## Introducing Two New Libraries for Angular + Web3

In just one week, Iâ€™ve built **two powerful libraries** to bridge the gap between **Angular** and **Web3**, making blockchain development smoother and faster for Angular developers. Let me introduce you to:

### âœ¨ **ngx-wagmi**

A fully **wagmi-compatible library for Angular 18**, built entirely with **Signal** for blazing-fast performance and seamless reactivity. Think of it as the essential toolkit to connect your Angular app to the blockchain, bringing powerful wallet and contract interactions to your fingertips.

### ðŸŒˆ **ngx-seedkit**

Inspired by RainbowKit but tailored for Angular, this library makes **wallet connection integration** a breeze. Powered by **ngx-wagmi**, it enables you to add wallet functionality to your application with minimal effort.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Whatâ€™s Included?**

- **ngx-wagmi**: A robust library for wallet connections and blockchain interactions.
- **ngx-seedkit**: A plug-and-play toolkit for creating stunning wallet connection UIs.
- A comprehensive **demo page**, showcasing nearly every function these libraries offer, so you can experience their full potential right away.

### ðŸŒŸ Why Use ngx-wagmi & ngx-seedkit?

- **Angular-First**: Designed for Angular 18, optimized for Signals.
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive APIs for quick integration.
- **Flexibility**: Customize and extend to suit your needs.
- **Web3 Ready**: Wallet connections, contract calls, and beyond.
